# Roguelike
This was a school project where i had to create a top down roguelike game in Java using the Processing library.

You spawn with a knight in a randomly generated cave and your goal is to get the key and then to enter the door, which will teleport you to another level. You can see your life in the bottom right of the screen, 
when it reaches zero the game closes. There are potions that heal you and potions that damage you.
